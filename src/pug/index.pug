                        | Hi! My name is Jessica Moreno, and I am an undergraduate student at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois. 
                        | I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Elementary Education and expect to obtain my teaching license for the state of Illinois by December 2020. 
                        |For part of my undergraduate degree, I received a Learning Behavior Specialist endorsement. Also as part of my undergraduate degree I received my Associate of Arts from the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. 
                        |â€‹I am currently student teaching 3rd grade at Kendall Elementary School in Naperville, Illinois and am enjoying every moment of it!

                        | I believe that children deserve an education that is tailored to each of their needs as much as possible.
                        | I understand that every student is unique and learns in different ways and at different paces. 
                        |Therefore, I make it my goal to meet students where they are and lead them towards success in every aspect of their education. 
                        |I endeavor to create an atmosphere where children are comfortable to ask questions, unafraid to make mistakes, eager to discover, and challenged to go above and beyond their goals and expectations. 
                        |It is my hope that my students will never want to stop learning!
